# Native world streaming handoff

Last updated: 2026-07-18

This file is the operational handoff for the native extended-world project
started from [Dryxio/mtasa-neon issue #1](https://github.com/Dryxio/mtasa-neon/issues/1).
It is intended to let a replacement orchestrator resume without reconstructing
the long development conversation.

The final goal is to let servers distribute multiple custom cities and have GTA
SA stream them through its native IDE/IMG/IPL system, as if they had been part
of the installed game data. Once a startup plan is active, a player should be
able to fly between San Andreas and the added cities without a custom Lua
streamer or a visible loading transition.

## Read first

Before changing anything, read these files completely:

1. `AGENTS.md` for the canonical tree, VM workflow, build targets, launch
   commands, verification expectations, and Git rules.
2. `LIMIT_PATCHING.md` for the executable-patching methodology and the limits
   already lifted for the extended world.
3. `utils/extended-world/NATIVE_BW_PACK.md` for the authoritative native-pack
   format, executable allowlist, audits, cache semantics, diagnostics, current
   Bullworth policy, and runtime failure boundaries.
4. `test-resources/native-world-transport-test/README.md` and `meta.xml` for the
   current server-transport declaration and manual test contract.

Treat this handoff as a status and navigation document. When a technical detail
disagrees with `NATIVE_BW_PACK.md` or the current code, investigate the current
code and update both documents rather than silently trusting this snapshot.

## Non-negotiable collaboration rules

- By default the user performs every in-game action and decides whether
  behavior is correct. Agents may run gameplay automation only when the user
  explicitly authorizes it for the current work, as happened for Checkpoint C;
  otherwise they stop at a ready build and provide exact test instructions.
- Keep the established orchestrated workflow. For major checkpoints, use a
  research/exploration/planning agent and an independent implementation/review
  agent where their work is useful. Keep file ownership clear and prefer
  read-only parallel work when edits would overlap.
- The primary orchestrator owns the implementation and final decisions. Work in
  short review loops: implement one coherent slice, obtain independent focused
  feedback, verify each finding against the actual code, apply only justified
  corrections, and request a second review of security- or lifecycle-sensitive
  fixes before formatting, tests, and VM builds. Sub-agents are
  counter-reviewers, not automatic decision makers.
- Define explicit checkpoints. Tell the user when a build is ready, what to do
  in game, what result to report, and when the client must be closed.
- Do not commit a gameplay-affecting checkpoint until the user has supplied the
  requested in-game feedback, or explicitly authorized an automated live gate,
  and the resulting evidence is understood.
- Do not skip safety reviews around executable writes, downloaded native data,
  cache publication, activation authorization, worker cancellation, native
  object lifetimes, or aggregate pool allocation.
- Preserve unrelated work in the dirty tree. Never stage or commit files merely
  because they appear in `git status`.
- Source edits, reviews, commits, and pushes happen only in the canonical macOS
  tree. The VM-local tree is a disposable build/runtime mirror. Do not push
  unless the user explicitly asks.

## Repository snapshot

At the time of this handoff:

```text
Canonical tree  /Users/salimtrouve/Documents/GitHub/mtasa-neon
Branch          master
Checkpoint C    163605d59 feat(native-world): activate authorized startup packs
Checkpoint D    453ca427b feat(native-world): restart into authorized startup packs
Checkpoint E1   0b8f07565 feat(native-world): publish generic static-world packs

VM              Windows 11
VM build tree   C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom
```

Always re-run `git status --short` and `git log -5 --oneline --decorate`; the
user and other agents work in this repository concurrently. Checkpoint A is
commit `b9ce96d3c`; the VM-helper marker repair is `3c8d608e5`. Both are now in
the history reachable from `origin/master`. Untracked `.claude`, `Tools`,
`game-resources`, `out.dff`, and `test-resources/synchronized-video-screen`
remain unrelated and must not be staged.
Re-establish ownership from the current diff before every later commit rather
than relying on this list.

## Implemented native-world checkpoints

Read the commit bodies as design records. The core sequence is:

| Commit | Checkpoint |
| --- | --- |
| `5edd8e7f9` | Opt-in native Bullworth prototype, native IDE/IMG/COL/binary IPL registration, required model-store/collision limits, native spatial streaming, and reconnect-safe streaming-buffer floor. |
| `8bbdd4a31` | Generic static-world pack manager separated from the immutable compiled Bullworth policy. |
| `1304f98d8` | Minimal versioned runtime manifest and derivation of the native allocation plan from IDE/IMG bytes. |
| `d65e8eee0` | Closed structural and semantic validation for RenderWare DFF/TXD, COL, IMG, IDE, and binary IPL payloads. |
| `5d43f18e5` | Immutable ProgramData cache with semantic content IDs, locked quarantine, atomic publication, reparse/path protections, guarded revalidation, and activation leases. |
| `7c38a9278` | Version-gated server resource transport, bounded HTTP streaming, asynchronous full audit, quotas, safe cancellation, atomic publish-only cache insertion, and legacy-client omission. |

Checkpoint A, the inert authorization record, is implemented in `b9ce96d3c`
and passed both non-game validation and the user-only live gate recorded below.
Checkpoint B, record-driven startup selection without native mutation, is
implemented in `5971c8a67`. Checkpoint C, record-driven native activation, is
implemented and passed the explicitly authorized automated live gate recorded
below. Checkpoint D, explicit safe restart/reconnect UX, is implemented and
passed the explicitly authorized automated live gate recorded below. Checkpoint
E1, the constrained generic static-world transport/cache identity, is
implemented and passed its explicitly authorized publish/cache-hit live gate
while remaining inert. Checkpoint E2, the generic format-2 authorization and
startup route, is implemented in the current checkpoint and passed the
explicitly authorized automated live and negative gates recorded below. The
next unfinished milestone is proving a genuinely different second city through
the same format-2 pipeline without city-specific C++.

Relevant earlier extended-world foundations include the enlarged world sectors,
coordinate/network ranges, water bounds, renderer capacity, radar composition,
and the earlier resident-IMG city prototype. Do not confuse that resident/custom
streamer with the native-world target. The old `ug-bw` resource must remain
stopped during native Bullworth tests because it owns the same models and
placements through a different lifecycle.

### Source map

- `Client/game_sa/CNativeWorldPackSA.*` and `CGameSA.*` contain the native pack
  policy/manager bridge, closed payload audit, preflight and registration path.
- `Client/game_sa/CNativeWorldCacheSA.*` contains semantic identity, guarded
  cache lookup/publication, quotas, remnant handling and activation leases.
- Client Deathmatch `CPacketHandler.cpp`, `CResource.*`,
  `CResourceFileDownloadManager.cpp`, and `CResourceManager.*` parse the
  versioned offer, enforce download identity, run/retire the asynchronous audit,
  and report its result. The resource captures the authorization offer on the
  main thread, carries an immutable snapshot through the worker, and asks Core
  to persist only after the exact audit/publication succeeds and the connection
  is still current.
- `Client/core/CNativeWorldAuthorizationStore.*`, Core connection management,
  and `Client/sdk/core/CNativeWorldAuthorization.h` own the connection epoch,
  opaque server/session identity capture, DPAPI-protected authorization store,
  inspection, clear/revoke operations, safe restart scheduling, process-aware
  diagnostics, and prepared-process credential suppression.
- Server Deathmatch `CResource.*`, `CResourceFile.*`,
  `packets/CResourceStartPacket.cpp`, and `CHTTPD.cpp` validate metadata,
  version-gate the group and stream the files.
- `Shared/sdk/net/bitstream.h` carries the protocol capability and
  `Shared/httpd/Types.h` carries the bounded file-response state.
- `utils/extended-world` contains the generator, validators and focused tests;
  `test-resources/native-world-transport-test` is the metadata-only legacy
  authorization harness, and `native-world-static-transport-test` is the
  metadata-only format-2 publish-only harness.
  `native-world-static-startup-test` is the metadata-only format-2 authorized
  startup harness; all large payload files remain VM-local test data.

## Current architecture

### Native startup path

`CNativeWorldPackManagerSA` performs exact preflight, allocation planning,
native commit, postconditions, IPL bootstrap, and process-lifetime management.
`CNativeBullworthPackSA` still owns the format-1 Bullworth policy, while the
manager also exposes the constrained `static-world-v1` format-2 policy. E2 can
authorize that policy only for an exact existing v2 cache object and feed its
fully audited plan through the same executable allowlist, allocation planning,
native commit, postconditions, IPL bootstrap, and process-lifetime lease. The
bounded pack ID remains untrusted metadata: it selects no parser budget,
executable patch, pool capacity, archive slot, or filesystem directory.

The legacy `MTA_NATIVE_BW_MODEL_STORES=1` prototype still reads the local
installation copy of `native-world.json` as its developer-only startup
selector. The record-driven path no longer needs that local selector: a clean
launch for the exact canonical numeric URI selects the pending authorization,
locks and fully reaudits the exact ProgramData object, performs the read-only
executable preflight, claims the ticket, and prepares the model stores. The
second session must reproduce the raw server-ID digest, canonical numeric
endpoint, and bitstream version immediately before `StartGame`; only then is
the hook installed and the typed lease committed after native postconditions.
A valid record and the legacy switch together remain terminally ambiguous and
suppress both routes. Successful native registration is process-global and
intentionally survives resource stops and exact-server reconnects; changing
packs or servers requires a clean client restart. Connection admission is
pinned from Candidate onward. A different endpoint requested while Active is
rejected before mod unload, network reset, credential copying, or queued-state
mutation, preserving the exact current session; pre-active mismatches remain
process-terminal. Every process-owned native-world phase is passwordless until
the opaque server identity is reproduced after connecting to the exact numeric
endpoint.

### Server transport and authorization-offer path

A resource declares exactly one `<native_world>` descriptor and exactly three
tagged automatic-download files: `native-world.json`, one IDE, and one IMG.
Format 1 remains either inert legacy transport or exactly
`startup="true" policy="bullworth"`. Format 2 is either the E1 publish-only
`policy="static-world-v1"` descriptor or the exact E2 tuple
`startup="true" policy="static-world-v1"`. Partial, unknown, or contradictory
metadata is rejected.

Clients through protocol capability `0x35` receive the original format-1 `N`
group byte-for-byte. Clients advertising the appended authorization capability
`0x36` receive the distinct complete `A` group only for an opted-in format-1
resource. The next append-only capability admits the format-2 `N` group.
A further append-only capability admits the complete format-2 `A` group with
authorization wire version 2 and one-shot startup mode. Clients lacking that
exact capability receive inert format-2 `N`, never an authorization downgrade.
Truncation, duplicates, bad placement, unknown groups, and unknown values are
fatal.

The built-in HTTP server streams file bodies through a 64 KiB buffer. After the
normal download size and checksum checks, a cancellable worker performs the
complete closed policy audit, copies/hashes into a random same-volume locked
quarantine, audits the copy, atomically renames the directory, and revalidates
the final immutable object. A cache hit follows the same guarded validation
path.

Transport alone still does not authorize or activate the object. An opted-in
format-1 or format-2 `A` offer may publish an inert authorization record only
after its exact object is cached. Publish-only format 2 still ends with
`audit=closed-static-world-v1 publish=atomic activation=no lease=no
restart-required=no`; opted-in format 2 ends pending with
`restart-required=yes`. Startup accepts format 2 only from the canonical
existing v2 object and promotes the lease as the pair
`(format=2, policy=static-world-v1)`; seed/local format-2 startup remains
forbidden.

Successful authorized format-1 diagnostics contain:

```text
[NativeWorldTransport] state=audit-started ... activation=no lease=no
[NativeWorldTransport] state=cached ... disposition=published|hit ...
    audit=closed-bullworth publish=atomic activation=no lease=no
    restart-required=yes
[NativeWorldAuthorization] state=pending ... activation=no lease=no
    restart-required=yes
```

The separation is essential:

```text
downloaded bytes -> checksum -> closed semantic audit -> immutable cache
immutable cache  != trusted server authorization
trusted authorization + exact cached content + clean startup -> activation
```

### Inert authorization store

Core owns the record rather than `CGame` or the resource worker. It captures
the external network module's opaque server ID, numeric IPv4 endpoint, exact
resource identity, policy/content identity, connection generation, and
authorization epoch before asynchronous work starts, then revalidates the
snapshot before persistence. The full opaque server ID is hashed into the
record; diagnostics expose only bounded correlation data, including the first
eight ticket hex digits.

Records use a canonical manually encoded little-endian format protected with
current-user DPAPI and purpose entropy. The store rejects reparse/ownership
violations, uses a cross-process transaction lock, CSPRNG tickets, a 15-minute
TTL with a bounded 120-second rollback allowance, explicit pending/revoked/spent
states, a live-record cap of 64 and hard enumeration cap of 256, and verified
atomic temp/flush/reopen/rename/final-reopen publication. Verified ambiguity and
terminalization markers prevent a crash or failed rename from silently turning
an uncertain record into an activatable one.

Connection generation and epoch are persisted only as launch-local audit
provenance. Checkpoint B must not compare them with counters from the next
process. A reconnect to the exact same durable identity attaches to the
existing fresh pending record without refreshing its ticket or timestamps;
conflicting identities refuse. Disconnect and normal destruction preserve the
record, while an explicit resource-stop packet revokes it. Console commands are
`nativeworldauth status` and `nativeworldauth clear`. Checkpoint B adds a strict
direct-URI selector, a transaction-held startup record, ticket-qualified spent
receipts, cancellation linearized with claim, and a typed exact-cache lease. It
deliberately adds no Lua API and performs no GTA activation.

### Cache policy

The versioned caches are rooted at:

```text
C:\ProgramData\MTA San Andreas All\1.7\native-world-cache\v1
C:\ProgramData\MTA San Andreas All\1.7\native-world-cache\v2
```

The validated Bullworth object used during the transport checkpoint had content
ID:

```text
6a090231416e0298eb78e671eba91d4c58ed1f9c16dfae94d162a81a52464824
```

The E1 format-2 fixture deliberately reused the Bullworth bytes but bound the
generic policy and pack identity into the distinct content ID:

```text
668bd36a1a2f686975277291032a2d3bef6048057660310d2673d4f5403fa645
```

The transport limits are a 4 KiB manifest, 1 MiB IDE, 256 MiB IMG, at most four
content objects total for the policy, at most 1 GiB counted data, and the
requested bytes plus a 64 MiB free-space margin. Unsafe siblings, reparse
points, unverifiable remnants, quota exhaustion, and immutable conflicts are
refused.

`netc.dll` is external and its in-tree ABI does not expose the underlying write
callback. A callback-local hard cap is therefore not currently possible. The
client instead bounds the declaration before queuing, polls visible progress,
rejects missing or divergent Content-Length and received-byte overflow, then
requires the exact final disk length and checksum. Treat an exact callback cap
as a possible future net-module/ABI improvement, not as implemented behavior.

## Validation already completed

Agents performed builds, static checks, log inspection, cache inspection, and
hash comparisons. The user performed the Checkpoint A in-game lifecycle; after
explicitly broadening authorization, the orchestrator automated the Checkpoint
B/C live gates through the documented VM workflow.

Confirmed checkpoints include:

- Checkpoint E2 was formatted with pinned clang-format 21.1.7. The focused
  suite reports 81 tests with two optional environment-dependent skips. Three
  independent architecture, security, and code/ABI reviews found no remaining
  actionable P0-P2 issue.
- The complete affected set (`Game SA`, `Client Core`, `Client Deathmatch`,
  `Multiplayer SA`, and `Client Webbrowser` as `Release|Win32`, plus server
  `Deathmatch` as `Release|x64`) built through reviewed `vm-build.ps1`
  plan/execute with zero errors.
- Format-2 content ID
  `668bd36a1a2f686975277291032a2d3bef6048057660310d2673d4f5403fa645`
  progressed through pending ticket `f9d7b810`, the explicit restart, exact v2
  cache reaudit, read-only executable preflight, claim, model-store preparation,
  second-session validation, hook, native commit, and `state=active
  lease=process`. The registrar reported archive 6, 952 models, 166 TXDs,
  collision slot 252, and seven IPL slots. Bullworth geometry/textures,
  collision, return to San Andreas, exact-server reconnect, resource
  stop/start preservation, and active clear/restart refusal all passed.
- The extended-world teleport/line-of-sight/vehicle/camera gate passed at
  X=+9500, and water creation/level/line-of-sight/vehicle passed at X=-9990.
  At ordinary coordinates and both extremes, all COL set/add/index checks and
  `moveObject` interpolation passed with intermediate motion, no regression or
  overshoot, and zero final error.
- A pending format-2 ticket was revoked by `ResourceStop`. A second pending
  ticket with its exact cache object quarantined ended in ticket-qualified
  terminal `cache-invalid`, created no replacement object, and became spent;
  the restored manifest, IDE, and IMG hashes were unchanged. Publish-only E1
  still created no record beyond the transaction lock, full format-1 startup
  still reached `state=active lease=process`, and a no-URI launch reported
  `state=absent` with restart refused and no new crash dump.
- Checkpoint E1 was formatted with the pinned clang-format 21.1.7 executable.
  The focused suite reports 77 tests, including two optional
  environment-dependent skips. Independent architecture and security reviews
  found no remaining actionable P0-P2 issue.
- The complete affected set (`Game SA`, `Client Core`, `Client Deathmatch`,
  `Multiplayer SA`, and `Client Webbrowser` as `Release|Win32`, plus server
  `Deathmatch` as `Release|x64`) built through reviewed `vm-build.ps1`
  plan/execute with zero errors.
- The authorized live gate first published and then cache-hit format-2 content
  ID `668bd36a1a2f686975277291032a2d3bef6048057660310d2673d4f5403fa645`.
  Independent hashing reproduced the ID, the v2 object contained exactly the
  canonical manifest, IDE, and IMG with the declared sizes and hashes, and both
  sessions ended `activation=no lease=no restart-required=no`. No format-2
  authorization record was created.
- An immediate format-1 regression retained the golden Bullworth content ID,
  completed its closed audit/cache hit, and produced the expected inert pending
  authorization with `activation=no lease=no restart-required=yes`. The client
  was then closed and the test-only pending file was removed offline; the
  earlier Checkpoint D gate already validates the public `clear` command.

- Checkpoint C was formatted with the pinned clang-format 21.1.7 executable.
  The focused suite reports 67 tests, including two optional
  environment-dependent skips. Two independent final security/lifecycle
  reviews found no remaining actionable P0-P2 issue.
- The affected client consumers (`Game SA`, `Client Core`, `Client
  Deathmatch`, `Multiplayer SA`, and `Client Webbrowser`) built Release|Win32
  through reviewed `vm-build.ps1` plan/execute and BuildOnly verification runs;
  every project completed with zero errors.
- Ticket `8ba5bfc8` completed the full authorized transaction: exact startup
  selection and cache audit, allowlisted executable preflight, durable claim,
  early model-store preparation, second-session identity validation, deferred
  hook installation, native registrar postconditions, and typed process-lease
  commit. The registrar reported archive 6, 952 models, 166 TXDs, collision
  slot 252, and seven IPL slots.
- An earlier active process using ticket `ce451b6c` survived two exact-server
  reconnects and a server/resource reload. Each new session logged
  `state=session-validated ... activation=active lease=process`; attempts by
  the startup resource to publish another descriptor correctly preserved the
  existing activation.
- The explicitly authorized runtime gate teleported the player to Bullworth
  `(-8148.06, 7648.97)`, returned to San Andreas `(1481.00, -1771.00)`, and ran
  the world-sync regression at Bullworth. COL SET, COL ADD, COL ADD INDEX, and
  MOVE all passed; MOVE ended with zero final error and no regression or
  overshoot. The temporary automation was removed from the canonical and VM
  resource copies after the run.
- The final diagnostic regression launch proved that a post-activation
  transport refusal now reports `activation=active lease=process
  existing-native-world=preserved`, rather than incorrectly implying that the
  active process reverted to stock.

- Checkpoint B was formatted with the pinned VM formatter. The focused suite
  reports 64 tests, including two optional environment-dependent skips, and an
  independent security/lifecycle re-review found no remaining P1/P2 issue in
  the startup transaction, cancellation/claim boundary, lease lifetime, or
  no-mutation path.
- The exact affected consumer set (`Game SA`, `Client Core`, `Client
  Deathmatch`, `Multiplayer SA`, and `Client Webbrowser`) built Release|Win32
  through the reviewed `vm-build.ps1` plan with zero errors and fresh verified
  outputs. Checkpoint B changed no server wire or server binary.
- The explicitly authorized automated live gate claimed ticket `fbdad662` only
  after exact URI selection, complete cache audit, allowlisted executable and
  patch-site preflight, and final cache revalidation. The resulting
  ticket-qualified `.spent` receipt preserved the original pending-file hash;
  the next network session published a distinct ticket. Completion logged
  `activation=no lease=released` and zero native writes, allocations, hooks,
  archives, and pool mutations.
- No-URI and wrong-port launches left the same pending ticket and file hash
  untouched. Temporarily moving the exact cache object aside caused
  `cache-invalid` terminal refusal and a spent receipt without recreating the
  object; restoring it reproduced the original manifest, IDE, and IMG hashes.
  Enabling the legacy environment selector alongside a valid record caused a
  terminal `selector-ambiguous` refusal, with no activation diagnostic.

- The current Checkpoint A tree was formatted with the pinned VM
  `clang-format.exe` 21.1.7 on the exact changed C++ files. PowerShell 7 was not
  available on the host or VM, so the repository wrapper could not be used.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s utils/extended-world/tests -p 'test_*.py'`
  now reports 53 passing tests and two optional environment-dependent skips.
  The added deterministic model covers golden plaintext/wire records, every
  truncation boundary, trailing/unknown data, capability gating, TTL/bounds,
  publication/teardown, and reconnect attachment without ticket/time refresh.
- The regenerated VM build completed successfully for `Game SA`, `Client Core`,
  `Client Deathmatch`, `Multiplayer SA`, and `Client Webbrowser` as
  `Release|Win32`, plus server `Deathmatch` as `Release|x64`. MSBuild reported
  zero errors and the helper verified all expected outputs, including
  `Bin\server\x64\deathmatch.dll`.
- Independent store/security, wire/test/documentation, and compile/ABI review
  loops found no remaining actionable issue after the orchestrator verified and
  corrected their findings. The final re-reviews were clean.
- The VM runtime resource still contains the known 169.5 MB Bullworth payload;
  only its 437-byte opt-in `meta.xml` was synchronized and SHA-256 verified.
- The freshly built server was started from the VM-local `Bin\server` tree,
  loaded 239 resources with zero failures, and listened as one process on
  `22003/UDP` and `22005/TCP`. `ug-bw` was configured with `startup="0"` and
  `native-world-transport-test` with `startup="1"`. The user launched the
  client only after this non-game preparation was complete.
- The user live gate first cleared the store and observed `state=absent`, then
  connected and published ticket `601ba255` for the exact known Bullworth
  content with `activation=no lease=no`. A complete client process restart and
  reconnect produced `disposition=attached` with unchanged issued/expires
  values, proving that reconnect did not refresh the 15-minute lifetime.
- An explicit server-console resource stop produced client `state=revoked` for
  ticket `601ba255`; `pending.bin` was replaced by the ticket-qualified revoked
  ledger entry and F8 status reported absent. Restarting the resource produced
  the distinct ticket `3b76cf5b` with `disposition=published`; the user then
  observed `state=cleared removed=yes` followed by `state=absent`. Every line
  retained `activation=no lease=no`, and no refusal, crash, hang, native
  registration, or Bullworth activation appeared in the inspected logs.
- The server confirmed both connection/join cycles and the user authorized the
  checkpoint commit. A separate respawn result was not explicitly reported, so
  respawn remains a prescribed general regression case rather than claimed
  evidence for Checkpoint A.
- `utils/vm-build.ps1` was repaired to recognize the stable CEF 147
  `libcef_dll\CMakeLists.txt` marker. CEF 147 removed the prior
  `wrapper\cef_helpers.cc` path, although the pinned package was complete. The
  reviewed bootstrap then restored the missing VM-local CEF dependency and the
  helper completed normally.
- `Game SA` and `Client Deathmatch` built as `Release|Win32` for the latest
  transport checkpoint.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s utils/extended-world/tests -p 'test_*.py'`
  reported 38 passing tests and two optional environment-dependent skips.
- The final independent transport/cache review reported no remaining
  actionable P0-P2 issue. The external net-module callback boundary below was
  recorded as an accepted residual rather than hidden.
- Native Bullworth loaded through GTA's IDE/IMG/COL and seven spatial binary
  IPLs with textures and collision.
- Travel into, around, away from, and back into Bullworth worked through native
  position-driven streaming.
- Repeated disconnect/reconnect and clean process restart were exercised during
  the native runtime series. Resource restart and respawn remain prescribed
  regression cases unless a later checkpoint records fresh evidence.
- A fresh resource transport downloaded the three files and completed the full
  closed audit.
- After the previous cache object was moved aside, transport reported
  `disposition=published`; the three resulting hashes exactly matched the
  known-good object and no quarantine sibling remained.
- A following reconnect reported `disposition=hit`, retained one object and
  unchanged hashes, and did not crash.
- Rollback with the native environment switch disabled preserved normal San
  Andreas behavior.

Historical regressions worth retaining in later test matrices are the
`gta_sa.exe+0x00331AB5` stale TXD reference crash after extended exploration,
the `gta_sa.exe+0x00004B85` reconnect/streaming-update crash, and the severe
one-frame-per-several-seconds stall after a Bullworth teleport. Their observed
test cases stopped reproducing after the corresponding fixes, but future
multi-pack or activation changes could reopen the same lifetime/capacity class
of bugs.

A server RPC wire regression was also reproduced and fixed on 2026-07-17.
`moveObject`, `setColPolygonPointPosition`, and both `addColPolygonPoint` forms
serialized versioned positions into an intermediate version-zero bitstream,
then copied those legacy-width bits into current recipient streams. The result
was a stationary/snap-teleporting object and corrupted polygon coordinates or
indices. Dedicated semantic packets now serialize into each destination stream
inside `Write`, preserving both legacy and current layouts. The tracked
`test-resources/world-sync-regression-test` is the live regression gate. The
user confirmed all four checks at ordinary coordinates, X=+9500, and X=-9990;
all movement runs had continuous intermediate samples, no regression or
overshoot, and zero final error. Retain this three-position matrix before later
protocol, activation, or multi-pack checkpoints are called complete.

The tracked `test-resources/native-world-transport-test` and
`native-world-static-transport-test` contain metadata and instructions only.
Their large audited payload is intentionally copied only into the VM runtime
resources and is never Git-indexed. Do not commit generated city assets.

## Known boundaries

- Format 2 can now authorize and activate one exact cached pack under the
  closed `static-world-v1` grammar. The validated fixture reused Bullworth
  bytes, so this is not yet proof of a second city or arbitrary IDE/IPL/IMG
  support.
- An opted-in format-1 or format-2 server can cause a strictly bound
  authorization record to be persisted after publication. The same closed
  startup selection, one-shot claim, executable gate, native commit, and typed
  process lease consume either exact tuple. Publish-only E1 format 2 remains
  inert.
- Only the legacy developer route depends on the local selector manifest and
  environment flag. The record-driven B route does not.
- The record is bound to the opaque server ID exposed by the established MTA
  session and the numeric endpoint. This is not a claim of PKI, authenticated
  DNS ownership, or any guarantee beyond the external network module.
- There is no aggregate multi-pack allocation or transactional registration of
  several cities.
- Native registration cannot currently be safely hot-unloaded. Treat active
  startup packs as process-lifetime state. The record-driven route pins that
  process to its exact numeric server endpoint: a different-server request is
  refused without unloading the active session and requires a clean restart.
  The legacy environment/local-selector developer route has no server record
  and therefore does not provide this server-isolation contract.
- Current generated Bullworth IPL placements use `lod_index = -1`; native
  spatial streaming and collision are validated, but GTA UG-equivalent
  long-distance LOD behavior is not.
- Radar tiles, water, CULL/occlusion, audio/environment data and interiors are
  separate from static IDE/IMG/IPL streaming. Path nodes, vehicle/ped paths,
  DAT expansion, streamed SCM, new IFP/RRR content, missions/savegames and
  ambient population are outside the multi-city capacity target. A later
  FileID relocation must still preserve their stock partitions and references.
  Missing Bullworth radar tiles are expected at this checkpoint.
- General multi-city capacities still require aggregate audits for model and
  streaming infos, TXDs, COL/IPL stores, archive/stream slots, buildings and
  pointer nodes, request lists, streaming memory/channels, LODs, and any
  optional city subsystem.

## Authorized startup research checkpoint

The read-only lifecycle, identity, persistence, replay, cache-lease, and
failure-boundary design checkpoint is complete. Its authoritative result is:

```text
utils/extended-world/NATIVE_WORLD_ACTIVATION.md
```

The review found no actionable P0-P2 issue in the publish-only path because it
was inert. Checkpoint A supplies the explicit server/session binding, separate
protocol capability, DPAPI-protected pending record, and conflicting
cross-server refusal. Checkpoint B now supplies exact-cache startup lookup, a
transaction-typed lease, atomic claim, strict startup endpoint matching, and
zero-mutation read-only executable preflight. Second-session identity
revalidation, deferred hook installation, irreversible native commit, and
typed process-lease promotion are now implemented by Checkpoint C.
Checkpoint D adds the explicit local restart command and active-process command
guards without weakening the startup identity boundary.

The server config initializes an identity facility from a private key, and the
client's opaque server ID is the strongest available continuity input. The
mapping and handshake live in the external network module, so the visible tree
does not prove key possession. Describe the record as bound to the opaque ID
exposed by the established MTA session, not as PKI, authenticated DNS
ownership, or a stronger guarantee than the external module documents.

The key lifecycle decision is that record/cache/executable preparation happens
before GTA initialization, while the native pack hook waits for the second
session to reproduce the exact server ID and numeric endpoint immediately
before `StartGame`. This narrows the unavoidable two-launch trust gap without
claiming that the second server can be contacted before early model-store
preparation.

## Completed checkpoint: inert authorization record

Checkpoint A implementation, non-game validation, and the user-only live gate
are complete. Persistence, exact reconnect attachment, explicit resource-stop
revocation, fresh republish, and explicit clear all behaved as designed. Every
observed line retained `activation=no lease=no`; no native registration or
automatic activation occurred.

The completed sequence, retained as the reproducible regression recipe, is:

1. Launch the exact custom `Multi Theft Auto.exe`, open F8 at the main menu,
   run `nativeworldauth clear`, then `nativeworldauth status`; expect
   `state=cleared ...` followed by `state=absent`.
2. Run `connect 127.0.0.1 22003`, wait for publication, and record the complete
   transport and authorization lines. Expect cached `published|hit`, pending
   authorization `disposition=published`, and restart-required yes, always with
   activation/lease no.
3. Run `nativeworldauth status`, record ticket prefix/issued/expires, then close
   the client completely without stopping the resource. Reopen it within the
   15-minute TTL and check status before connecting; expect the same record.
4. Reconnect to the same endpoint. Expect `disposition=attached`, with the same
   ticket prefix and unchanged issued/expires rather than a refreshed record.
5. While connected, type `stop native-world-transport-test` in the server
   console. Expect `state=revoked`; client status must then be absent.
6. Type `start native-world-transport-test` in the server console, wait for a
   fresh pending record, clear it from F8, and verify status is absent.
7. Confirm GTA reaches spawn and record whether movement/respawn was exercised;
   the connect/close/reconnect/resource-stop sequence must have no crash, hang,
   native registration, Bullworth activation, or stock-world regression.
   Preserve the exact client/server logs for orchestrator inspection.

The completed read-only design/research checkpoint covered:

1. Trace the precise MTA connection, server identity, resource-start, game
   startup, reconnect, and shutdown sequence.
2. Inventory what authenticated or stable server identity MTA already exposes.
   Do not claim cryptographic authentication if the existing protocol cannot
   provide it; document the actual trust boundary.
3. Design a closed, versioned activation record bound at minimum to the server
   identity, exact policy key and content ID, protocol/format version, freshness
   or expiry, and intended one-shot/replay behavior.
4. Define atomic persistence, crash recovery, tamper refusal, cancellation, and
   cleanup behavior.
5. Define the two-launch flow: first connection downloads/audits/publishes and
   requests a restart; the clean next startup validates the record and cache
   before the irreversible native commit, then reconnects to the intended
   server.
6. Define fail-soft behavior before IDE commit and fatal behavior after an
   irreversible partial native commit.
7. An implementation plan and independent security/lifecycle review before
   editing activation code.

The authorized-startup sequence is complete:

- **Checkpoint A — inert authorization record (complete):** receive, validate,
  persist, inspect, expire, attach on exact
  reconnect, revoke on explicit resource stop, and clear the record, while
  always logging `activation=no lease=no`.
- **Checkpoint B — startup selection (complete):** validate the
  record at clean startup, locate and fully revalidate the exact immutable
  object, acquire the pending
  activation lease, complete the read-only executable preflight, and only then
  claim the record atomically without committing GTA state.
- **Checkpoint C — native activation (complete):** feed the selected object
  into the existing preflight/commit path, revalidate the exact second session
  before `StartGame`, remove the environment/local-selector requirement for
  this route, and keep rollback/fatal boundaries intact.
- **Checkpoint D — restart/reconnect UX (complete):** expose an explicit local
  restart to the exact fresh numeric endpoint, refuse conflicting loader
  actions, suppress credentials, and make status/clear/restart process-aware.

Each checkpoint needs negative tests for wrong server, wrong content ID,
missing/corrupt cache, expired/replayed/tampered record, disconnect during
publication, resource stop, crash between write and consume, and a modified or
unsupported GTA executable. Request gameplay validation or use explicitly
authorized automation only after the relevant builds, logs, and non-game checks
pass.

## Completed checkpoint: restart and reconnect UX

Checkpoint D adds `nativeworldauth restart`. It inspects a structured pending
record under the authorization transaction, requires at least 60 seconds of
remaining freshness, constructs only the exact canonical numeric
`mtasa://<ip>:<port>` target, and schedules the loader restart only after an
exact write/flush/readback check. An unrelated non-empty loader action is never
overwritten. The restart diagnostic deliberately reports
`credential=suppressed` and never includes a password.

Prepared startup discards the supplied in-memory credential before it can be
copied or used and skips browser-password recovery before the credential-bearing
Deathmatch join. It does not erase MTA's general saved credential storage. This
is intentional: the external network module exposes the server identity only
after the join path begins, so passworded startup authorization is unsupported
until an identity proof is available before credentials could be disclosed.
The restart handoff must not restore password support by adding a password to
the authorization record, loader action, diagnostics, or connection CVARs.

Status now reflects the current process: an active native pack reports
`state=active activation=yes lease=process restart-required=no`. `clear` and
`restart` are refused throughout prepared, session-validated, hook-installed,
and active phases, so an authorization command cannot invalidate or replace a
process-global native registration.

The explicitly authorized automated gate used ticket `4e97a97f`. The first
client scheduled an exact restart and exited cleanly; the replacement process
was launched with `mtasa://127.0.0.1:22003`, retained the same ticket, audited
and claimed the cache, revalidated the session, and reached
`state=active lease=process`. Active status, clear refusal, restart refusal, an
exact `/reconnect`, and the extended-world teleport/line-of-sight/vehicle/camera
sanity at x=7000 all passed. After a clean exit, a launch without a URI reported
`state=absent`; restart was refused and did not exit or alter the loader action.
The focused suite reports 70 tests with two optional environment-dependent
skips. `Client Core` and `Client Deathmatch` each built twice as
`Release|Win32` with zero errors.

After the final credential-ordering and single-write loader hardening review,
ticket `93e09b84` repeated the real restart path: the old process logged the
exact passwordless scheduled action, the loader consumed it once, the new PIDs
retained the ticket, and launch 2 again reached `state=active lease=process`.

This gate did not claim live coverage for passworded servers, wrong-key reuse,
resource-stop races, expiry during restart, unsupported executables, cache
corruption, respawn, or the full world-sync resource. Those remain prescribed
negative/regression scenarios; Checkpoint C already supplied the x=9500,
water, COL synchronization, and `moveObject` live regression evidence.

## Completed checkpoint: active-pack server isolation

The record-driven path already refused another endpoint before
`StartNetwork`, but the guard ran after console/mod unload, network reset, and
connection-state mutation, then terminalized an otherwise valid Active
process. The current hardening moves a common target guard before every such
effect in console connect/reconnect and `CConnectManager`, validates queued
server-forced reconnects before committing their state, and retains the
immediate pre-`StartNetwork` invariant check.

Candidate is now pinned rather than temporarily exempt. Credentials are
suppressed for every phase other than Off, including Active exact reconnect,
because endpoint equality precedes the opaque server-ID proof. Active
different-target requests preserve the existing session and process lease and
report that changing servers requires a clean restart; earlier-phase mismatch
continues to terminate fail-closed.

The user-run live gate completed with format-2 ticket `5d0d35f3`. The clean
restart reached `state=active activation=yes lease=process`; the registrar
reported the exact `mta-runtime-3608` TXD profile, archive 6, 952 models, 166
TXDs, collision slot 252, and seven IPL slots. An F8 `connect 127.0.0.1 22004`
then reported `state=connection-refused reason=endpoint-mismatch` while retaining
the `127.0.0.1:22003` session, active lease, and native world. Exact `reconnect`
returned to port 22003 and revalidated the same ticket with
`activation=active lease=process`. After a clean client exit, a no-URI process
reported `state=absent` and `connect 127.0.0.1 22004` produced an ordinary
network connection attempt rather than a native-world refusal.

`Client Core` and `Client Deathmatch` built as `Release|Win32` with zero
errors through the reviewed VM plan/execute workflow. The focused suite reports
83 tests with two optional environment-dependent skips, `git diff --check` is
clean, and two independent final security/code-path reviews found no remaining
actionable P0-P2 issue.

An immediately preceding attempt with ticket `151e80c0` refused before any
pack mutation because the aggregated TXD pointer/capacity/cursor precondition
did not match. A later read in that process showed the expected capacity 5000
and cursor 3607, and the clean retry above passed with the exact same Game SA
and Multiplayer binaries and canonical source hashes. Treat this as a
non-reproduced launch-order observation: if it recurs, log the pool pointer,
object pointer, bitmap pointer, capacity, and cursor individually before
changing the closed TXD profile.

## Remaining global roadmap

The aggregate static model-store foundation is implemented on `master`: the
existing fully manifested relocation is sized to `32000` Atomic, `512`
DamageAtomic and `1024` Time. Its policy reads back the manifest capacities
before pack mutation. This is intentionally independent of the future FileID
relocation and does not make IDs >= 20000 valid.

The user-run Checkpoint 1 live gate completed on 2026-07-18 with format-1
ticket `46a33f60`. The clean restart selected, audited and claimed the exact
Bullworth cache object, revalidated the `127.0.0.1:22003` session, and reached
`state=active activation=yes lease=process`. The registrar reported archive 6,
952 models, 166 TXDs, collision slot 252 and seven IPL slots. Runtime
diagnostics proved the new stores active at `14854/32000` Atomic, `136/512`
DamageAtomic and `175/1024` Time; the same occupancy remained stable after an
exact reconnect. The streaming-buffer floor clamped both observed requests to
4008 blocks. Client logs contained no fatal, preflight, capacity, exception or
crash diagnostic, and the server recorded clean join/quit/reconnect cycles.
The expected post-activation transport refusals preserved the existing native
world rather than attempting to republish into the active registrar.

The FileID abstraction and stock-only relocation checkpoints are complete on
`master`. The relocation was developed in the isolated
`codex/native-world-fileid-relocation` worktree, rebased without conflict over
the story changes, then fast-forwarded into `master`. On 2026-07-19 its exact
file set was synchronized with verified hashes to the VM-local tree. `Game SA`
and `Client Deathmatch` both built successfully as `Release|Win32`, including
the Game SA post-link hook verifier. It has not yet been launched in game.

The checkpoint installs the stock-only FileID relocation after the optional
model-store preflight. The resulting layout is DFF 0, TXD 32,000, COL 40,000,
IPL 40,512, DAT 41,536, IFP 41,600, RRR 41,780, SCM 42,255, loaded 42,337,
requested 42,339 and total 42,341. The old 44,325 figure assumed DAT 2,048;
DAT is the path-node partition and is now explicitly kept at its stock count of
64. IFP/RRR/SCM counts also remain stock. Only DFF/TXD/COL/IPL address space is
reserved at this checkpoint; TXD/COL/IPL store counts are not enlarged yet.

The generated manifest contains 1,276 non-overlapping normal-executable writes:
712 model pointers, 308 streaming pointers, 222 base operands, 27 unsigned
linked-list opcode fixes, four sentinel IDs, two save/load redirects and one
`nextModelOnCd` sentinel-control hook. The latter prevents unsigned `0xFFFF`
from bypassing GTA's stock 32-bit `-1` end-of-chain comparison. The new tables
are process-lifetime allocations, the complete stock contents are mapped
partition by partition, and save compatibility remains exactly 26,316 flag
bytes including the four list sentinels. Capture and the final pre-commit pass
both require all expected operands.
Existing runtime `CGame` accessors still route Game SA, Multiplayer SA, Client
Core and Client Deathmatch consumers through the relocated state.

The focused static suite and off-game raw HOODLUM validator pass, including
deterministic regeneration from the local FLA sources: 1,276 writes, 98
runnable extended-world tests, two fixture-dependent skips and a clean diff
check. The reviewed `utils/vm-build.ps1` transaction copied all ten checkpoint
files, then a one-file corrective transaction added the mandatory local-size
verification to the naked IMG-chain hook. The final `Game SA` and `Client
Deathmatch` builds completed with zero errors. The remaining gate is stock-SA
runtime validation before any city pack is activated.

The first runtime attempt failed closed during capture, before native writes,
at operand `0x006B2187`. The generated FLA manifest had resolved the shared
name `MODEL_SKIMMER` through a non-SA enum as ID 190 instead of GTA SA ID 460;
the complete named-model audit also corrected `MODEL_HUNTER` from 155 to 425.
The generator now validates all file-stable pointer operands against the raw
HOODLUM executable, with only five exact unpacker-reconstructed sites exempted,
and tests pin both SA IDs. The corrected manifest, richer expected/actual
runtime diagnostic, 99-test suite, `Game SA` build/hookcheck and `Client
Deathmatch` build all pass. Repeat the stock-SA runtime gate with this rebuilt
DLL.

The user-run live gate completed on 2026-07-18 with format-1 ticket `7a1a461a`.
The initial stock process and the authorized replacement process both emitted
the exact `[NativeFileID] state=captured layout=stock ... total=26316 ...
nativeWrites=no` diagnostic. Bullworth activated as archive 6 with 952 models,
166 TXDs, collision slot 252 and IPL slots 191 through 197. `/nativebw` worked
before and after an exact reconnect; the reconnect revalidated the same ticket
and process lease, retained `14854/32000` Atomic, `136/512` DamageAtomic and
`175/1024` Time occupancy, and clamped the streaming request to 4008 blocks.
The client/server logs contained no FileID mismatch, preflight/capacity failure,
exception or fatal diagnostic, and no new dump was created. DFF/TXD
replace/restore must be repeated as a focused regression when the new
42,341-entry relocation is first run. Do not reintroduce any private pointer or
partition constant.

After the preceding authorized activation, item 1 is complete: E2 extends the E1 format-2
transport boundary with strict authorization/startup without weakening format
1. Continue with:

1. Prove that a second city, preferably Carcer, uses the same pipeline without
   city-specific C++.
2. Build a deterministic aggregate startup plan for multiple packs, including
   conflict detection and all combined pool/store/archive/streaming limits.
3. Transactionally register San Andreas plus Bullworth plus Carcer in one
   process through native GTA streaming.
4. Tune streaming memory, buffers, request lists, spatial IPL behavior and
   LOD/prefetch behavior for seamless repeated flights and stable FPS.
5. Add optional pack components and validators for radar, water,
   CULL/occlusion, audio, timecycle and interiors. Do not expand paths/nodes,
   DAT, streamed SCM, IFP/RRR, missions/savegames or ambient population as part
   of the static multi-city target.
6. Add server/admin/client status APIs for cached, restart-required, active,
   refused, and planned packs, with explicit process-lifetime semantics.
7. Provide reproducible pack conversion, canonical-manifest generation,
   conflict reporting, budget estimation, and FLA/GTA UG configuration
   comparison tools.
8. Harden with fuzzing, hostile-server cases, cache/ticket recovery, telemetry,
   long reconnect/restart cycles, and several-hour multi-city endurance tests.
9. Freeze protocol/pack versions, document deployment and rollback, add CI
    fixtures, and retire or isolate the old custom-streaming workarounds.

Practical milestones are: Bullworth without preinstallation; Carcer through the
same generic path; Bullworth and Carcer simultaneously; seamless native flights;
city radar/environment support; then production hardening.
