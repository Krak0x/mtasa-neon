# Nines and AK's

This resource reproduces the playable graph of GTA San Andreas mission `sweet2`, displayed as **Nines and AK's**.

## Canonical references

- Script: `SCRIPT_NAME sweet2` in `main.scm`.
- Decompiled block: `mission_start_sweet2` through `mission_cleanup_sweet2`.
- Mission text block: `SWEET2`.
- File cutscenes: `SWEET3A` and `SWEET3B`.
- Mission audio family: `SWE3_*`, plus `MSWE07*`, `SMOX_*` reminders and `MOBRING`.
- Mission pass identifier: `SWEET_2`.
- Installed `main.scm` SHA-256 used for the independent audit: `601def3baae766ce6a23e2f0b9b48f6b33c9a64e2fc32eb4f22ddea8b868b0fa`.

The raw bytecode was used to resolve ambiguous decompiler symbols. In particular, the three contextual shooting helps are `HOOD2A`, `HOOD2B`, and `HOOD2F`, and the installed bytecode's bottle Z values supersede several incorrect floating-point values in the decompile.

## Start

The resource requires the Neon client runtime, `native-task-runtime` and `story-entry-exit-runtime`.

```text
start native-task-runtime
start story-entry-exit-runtime
start nines-and-aks
```

Start the mission with either command:

```text
/nines
/ninesandaks
```

Only one mission session may run at a time. The test owner is placed in dimension `4103`. The resource does not launch or control a client process.

## Reachable mission graph

| Phase | SCM behavior covered |
| --- | --- |

| Binco | Outside arrival camera and `S2HELP1`, exact automatic `CSCHP` doorway, area 15 interior staging, `S2HELP2` and `HELWARD`, exact automatic exit and required return to area 0 before pass |
| Pass/fail | Mission pass presentation, Colt 45 net gain, Smoke/Emmet/CJ/Glendale failures and deterministic cleanup |

## Runtime ownership

The server owns the mission state, actors, vehicles, authoritative stage changes, player snapshot, pass/fail decision and cleanup. The mission client owns native cutscene/audio/camera leases, native ped tasks for the local syncer, local target bottles, their damage evidence, navigation and the Binco tutorial presentation. The separate story entry-exit runtime owns Binco's paired IPL triggers, fade transaction and server-authoritative area transition.

The resource waits for managed file-cutscene release before asking the server to create model 302. Neon maps that playable slot to `EMMET`; creating the ped before `SWEET3B` teardown would race the temporary CUTOBJ model mapping.

## Exact, adapted and excluded behavior

### Phase coverage matrix

| Phase | Exact/runtime-equivalent | Adapted | Excluded |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SWEET3A` | File cutscene, area-visible 1 lease, GXT lease, CJ model/clothes, fade and release barrier | Mission dimension isolates ambient world | Campaign mission-given counter |
| Glendale outbound | Model, plate, COL base Z, colors, Smoke passenger seat, Bounce FM, friendly/destination blip swap, all-wheels/seat/position gate, nine audio lines | `DM_PED_MISSION_EMPTY` and SCM-only ped flags unavailable | Global car generator and zone density bookkeeping |
| Emmet arrival | Fixed camera, controls off, Smoke native leave plus two native go-to children, CJ delayed leave/go-to, black fade, `SWEET3B` | Native go-to children replace GTA's route buffer | Global gang-size limit |
| Range setup | Emmet slot 302, Tampa model/plate/base Z, actors and Colt 45 ammo | MTA model bootstrap supplies the special character | None in reachable gameplay |
| Round 1 | Raw-bytecode demo/player bottle Z, centre offset, native Smoke shot, all fixed cuts and break timing, `SWE3_BC/DC`, `HOOD2A`, 1-hit server gate | Object-damage event replaces SCM polling | Object lock-on flag unavailable |

| Range boundary | `SWE2_J`, range blip, pistol ammo 10 outside and 30000 on return throughout all three rounds and the Tampa objective | Server applies ammo after client boundary evidence | SCM conditional-help internal flag storage |
| Tampa | Exact actor/vehicle staging, petrol-cap weakpoint opt-in, two camera shots, controls, delayed proof removal and blown-state server gate | Ped explosion proofs unavailable | None beyond unavailable proof primitive |
| Leave Emmet | Two-second post-explosion hold, black staging/preload, exact headings, four cameras, 14 lines with 200 ms gates, mandatory first line, front-edge skip, walks, look-at, native entries and seat barrier | Server warp is the 50-second deterministic fallback and skip path | Exact nested dialogue animation microtiming |
| Return drive | Blip swap, reminders `SMOX_AA..AE`, `SWE2_L`, `HELP53/HOOD2D/HOOD2E`, `EMMET_G`, seven-line dialogue and arrival gates | Dialogue restarts after a vehicle reminder | Persistent global Emmet shop unlock |

| Binco | Exterior camera/help, exact `CSCHP` half-extents and `+1.0` Z conversion, automatic on-foot entry/exit, headings, area 15 tutorial gate, 1500+4000 ms tutorial, retained blip and server-validated area 0 pass | Safe leased fade/teleport service replaces MTA's disabled native manager | Native door task, shop peds and clothing purchase UI, which vanilla does not gate |
| Result | Failure reason plus big fail, big pass with respect 4, passed tune, pistol old ammo +60 | Test session restores the original player snapshot on teardown | Respect, progress, contact, save and shop-blip persistence |

### Exact or runtime-equivalent

- Native file cutscenes, mission GXT, mission audio IDs and scripted camera ownership.
- Smoke model 269 and Neon special-model slot 302 for Emmet.
- Glendale/Tampa models, plates, key positions, headings and mission dimensions.
- One, three and five target layouts using `DYN_WINE_BIG` model 1551.
- Colt 45 target damage, Tampa destruction, actor/vehicle death gates and all-wheels arrival gates.
- All reachable dialogue arrays and required Binco entry/interior/exit topology.
- Player appearance, weapons, health, armor, position and dimension are snapshotted for deterministic failure/resource-stop restoration.

### Adapted with existing public APIs

- `TASK_FOLLOW_POINT_ROUTE` is represented by the scripted Emmet-arrival transition. The current public sequence surface has native point-to-point movement, but not SCM route-buffer ownership.
- Smoke's shooting demonstrations use native `shoot_at` sequence children, stock Colt/roll animations and progress-driven native camera/audio timing. The exact nested repeat, duck toggle, post-shot idle and achieve-heading children are not public yet.
- `TASK_USE_MOBILE_PHONE` uses the stock phone animation while the exact native phone task is not exposed.
- Binco leases `cschp_ls` from the generic story entry-exit runtime. The runtime applies the installed exterior/interior IPL rectangles, GTA's verified `+1.0` Z conversion, automatic on-foot contact, one-second fades and authoritative area/position changes. Vanilla `sweet2` does not inspect a purchased clothing item, so omitting the purchase interface preserves its actual pass condition.
- The interior tutorial and final pass delay resume from the runtime's terminal `entered`/`exited` barriers, after its destination and fade checks complete; the intermediate black-screen commit is not treated as a playable mission state.
- Local bottle damage events replace the SCM `HAS_OBJECT_BEEN_DAMAGED` polling flag.

### Known native-surface limits

- MTA does not currently expose `MAKE_OBJECT_TARGETTABLE` or `IS_PLAYER_TARGETTING_OBJECT`. Bottles are breakable and valid only when damaged by the mission player, but controller lock-on to an object is not asserted by this resource.
- `DM_PED_MISSION_EMPTY` has no public runtime lease.
- Smoke's SCM-only `ONLY_DAMAGED_BY_PLAYER`, `CANT_BE_DRAGGED_OUT`, `STAY_IN_CAR_WHEN_JACKED`, and `GET_OUT_UPSIDE_DOWN` combination is not fully public. The resource intentionally avoids applying the broad story-protection preset because that preset prevents upside-down exits, opposite the mission script.
- Temporary ped explosion proofs around the Tampa sequence do not have a public ped-physical-proof API.
- MTA returns immediately from `CEntryExitManager::Update` because its legacy native transition path crashes. The safe Lua runtime reproduces the mission-visible pairing and transition, but not GTA's native door task, shop population or clothing menu.
- Gang-zone strength bookkeeping, contact unlocks, global shop blips, persistent Emmet pickup, respect/progress counters and save-game mission statistics are solo campaign bookkeeping and remain outside Story Runtime scope.

## Failure and cleanup matrix

| Condition | Result |
| --- | --- |
| CJ dies | Mission failed, session restored |
| Smoke dies | `SWE2_B`, mission failed, session restored |
| Glendale explodes before Smoke's final arrival gate | `SWE2_C`, mission failed, session restored |
| Emmet dies while present | Emmet failure, mission failed, session restored |
| Tampa explodes during its objective | Advance once to the departure scene |
| File cutscene request/load/start/release fails or times out | Mission failed instead of silently advancing |
| Binco entry-exit acquisition or transition times out | Mission failed and the previous frozen/camera state is restored |
| Player disconnects | Destroy session entities without attempting player restoration |
| Resource stops | Release client leases, destroy local bottles/navigation, restore the player and destroy server entities |

The client rejects bottle damage unless the source is a current player-round bottle and the attacker is the mission player. Repeated Tampa notifications are stage-gated on the server.

## Validation state

The SCM graph, raw bottle coordinates, camera vectors, audio order, stage gates and cleanup paths are statically mapped. The Binco pass was independently checked against the installed SCM, both linked `CSCHP` IPL records and the reverse entry-exit loader and volume rules. User testing reached the Emmet range and exposed the file-cutscene crash, area visibility and initial camera-sequencing defects. The corrected managed-cutscene and story entry-exit paths pass static validation, but the latest camera timing, bottle-height, Tampa petrol-cap, departure and complete Binco transition still require a fresh in-game run. This checkpoint does not claim full 1:1 runtime validation.

## Validation checklist

Static validation:

```sh
luac -p test-resources/nines-and-aks/shared.lua \
  test-resources/nines-and-aks/server.lua \
  test-resources/nines-and-aks/client.lua
luac -p test-resources/story-entry-exit-runtime/definitions.lua \
  test-resources/story-entry-exit-runtime/server.lua \
  test-resources/story-entry-exit-runtime/client.lua
git diff --check
```

In-game validation remains manual:

1. Play both native file cutscenes to completion and repeat with skip input.
2. Verify Smoke enters MTA passenger seat 1 and both arrival gates refuse an upside-down Glendale.
3. Leave and re-enter the Glendale on both drives and verify navigation/reminders swap correctly.
4. Complete the 1/3/5 bottle rounds and verify only CJ damage advances them.
5. Walk outside the range and return during every round.
6. Shoot the Tampa petrol cap after control returns, verify the weakpoint explosion, and verify the departure scene starts exactly once.
7. Complete and skip the Emmet departure scene.
8. Complete the Smoke goodbye and phone dialogue, reach the exterior objective in a vehicle, then verify only CJ on foot can cross the exact Binco doorway automatically.
9. Verify both one-second fades, area 15, the interior camera after its 1500 ms wait, `S2HELP2`, `HELWARD`, the automatic exit heading and the two-second pass delay.
10. Kill Smoke, destroy the Glendale, kill Emmet and die as CJ in separate runs.
11. Restart both the mission and entry-exit runtime during Binco's fade-out, black hold, fade-in and interior stage.

Do not commit a mission checkpoint until this in-game matrix has been validated. The commit message should record the source mission, fidelity goals, design reasoning and exact tests performed.
