# 2026-07-12 native entity attribution

This targeted pass used the varied built-in model set at origin
`(-690.64, 957.41, 12.19)`, five-second warm-ups and five-second samples. The
client ran in the foreground with `timingdebug on`. Diagnostic checkpoint
overhead makes the FPS distribution unsuitable for direct comparison with the
non-instrumented profiles; the purpose of this run is subsystem attribution.

Representative one-second native snapshots from the measurement windows:

| ped visible/separate | 27-31 ms | 11-15 ms | 7-9 ms, 131-140 calls | 1-2 ms, 110 calls | 1-3 ms, 110 calls | 1-2 ms, 74-80 calls |

The measured collision-call count exceeds the entity count because
`CWorld::Process` retries entities that remain outside a safe position. For 64
touching vehicles, `CPhysical::ProcessCollision` consumed roughly 80-90% of
the measured `CWorld_Process` time. For 110 near peds it consumed roughly
55-75%. This makes native collision the first CPU optimization target for both
populations; MTA manager pulses were generally below 1 ms.

Visible separated vehicles still cost about 8.5 ms more per frame than hidden
vehicles even though measured automobile PreRender was at most about 1 ms and
their native world time was not higher. That remaining visible delta is outside
the current entity scopes. Instrument native `Render`/atomic traversal and use
an external GPU capture before deciding whether it is render-thread submission,
driver overhead, GPU work, or presentation waiting.

For peds, visible versus hidden differed by about 4 ms. The visible samples
accounted for roughly 1-3 ms of animation update and 1-2 ms of PreRender, while
near collision remained the largest component in both camera modes. A blanket
ped animation rewrite would therefore target a secondary cost before collision.

The client completed all eight stages and remained responsive. No crash was
observed.

## Follow-up

The later internal collision pass is archived in
`2026-07-12-vm-deep-collision-attribution.md`. It splits sector scans,
`ProcessEntityCollision`, `ProcessColModels`, contacts, retry ordinals, unsafe
entities, and shift work. It also records the first optimization candidate, a
world-AABB prefilter that produced zero rejections and was rolled back.
