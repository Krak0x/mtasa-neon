# MTA:SA Neon Engine

MTA:SA Neon is an experimental fork of [Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas](https://github.com/multitheftauto/mtasa-blue), focused on prototyping advanced engine features and exploring changes that may be too early or too specialized for the upstream project.

The repository preserves the complete upstream history and adds proof-of-concept work on top of it. Neon is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Multi Theft Auto team.

Readers familiar with the historical [MTA:Eir](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/MTA:Eir) project may recognize a related ambition: using an independent MTA:BLUE-derived codebase as a laboratory for deeper GTA:SA engine integration, expanded streaming and IMG workflows, reverse-engineered native features, and new scripting APIs. Neon is not a continuation of or affiliated with MTA:Eir; the comparison is about scope and experimental spirit.

## MTA:SA vs MTA:SA Neon

Neon keeps MTA:SA's resource model and default gameplay behavior while lifting selected GTA:SA engine limits and exposing new opt-in features to resources. The figures below describe the currently implemented Neon client/server patches and resource workflows.

| Area | MTA:SA | MTA:SA Neon |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| GTA corona pool | 64 | 4,096 (4,094 available to scripted MTA coronas) |
| GTA 3D marker pool | 32 | 4,096 |
| GTA checkpoint pool | 32 | 4,096 |
| GTA checkpoint direction arrows | 5 | 4,096 |
| GTA attribute CULL zones | 1,300 | 4,096 |
| GTA tunnel CULL zones | 40 | 256 |
| GTA mirror CULL zones | 72 | 256 |
| Native CULL-zone editing | Not exposed to Lua | Client Lua CRUD with stable IDs, resource-scoped cleanup, and 3D diagnostics |
| Visible entity pointers | 1,000 | 8,192 |
| Visible LOD pointers | 1,000 | 8,192 |
| Streaming RenderWare object instances | 2,500 | 30,000 |
| Main world-sector grid | 120 x 120 | 400 x 400 |
| LOD world-sector grid | 30 x 30 | 100 x 100 |
| Supported extended-world XY | Approximately -3,000 to +3,000 | -10,000 to +9,999 |
| Native minimap tiles | Fixed 12 x 12 stock grid, approximately -3,000 to +3,000 | Sparse 40 x 40 logical grid covering -10,000 to +9,999, with resource-owned TXDs and protected stock tiles |
| Extended F11 world map | Packaged San Andreas map | Dynamic atlas composed from GTA's native tiles and registered extended tiles, with catalog-derived world bounds |
| Large IMG-backed map residency | Basic client-side IMG linking | Resource-managed per-client residency for large map packs, with bounded model/TXD allocation, scene preloading, teardown-safe slot reuse, and optional switching |
| MTA pickup visual XY | -4,096 to +4,095.875 | -10,000 to +9,999 |
| Low-precision networked XY | Approximately -8,192 to +8,192 | -10,000 to +10,000 for Neon-capable connections |
| Absolute networked camera range | Approximately -8,192 to +8,192 | Approximately -16,384 to +16,384 for Neon-capable connections |
| Custom-water block grid | 12 x 12 (144 blocks) | 40 x 40 (1,600 blocks) |
| Custom-water XY | Approximately -3,000 to +3,000 | -10,000 to +9,999 |
| Procedural seabed boundary | Unlimited | Server-configurable from 3,000 to 10,000, or unlimited |
| Project2DFX distant static lights | Not integrated | Native, resource-controlled implementation with a 300-5,000 draw-distance range |
| Local asset preview workflow | Build a resource and load the replacement | Experimental drag-and-drop DFF/TXD skin and IFP animation previews for developers |
| Server-authoritative custom models | Client-local dynamic model allocations only | Stable resource-owned vehicle/object IDs mapped to per-client runtime slots, with synchronized lifecycle and native-parent fallback |
| Model-native ped walking styles | No explicit synchronized model-native mode | Server/client Lua opt-in that follows skin changes and ped recreation |
| SA-MP-style fast weapon strafe | Not available as a synchronized glitch | Optional `fastweaponstrafe` glitch, server-synchronized and disabled by default |
| Neon diagnostics and stress tests | Not included | Reproducible resources for limits, rendering, extended-world systems, radar/F11 composition, model-registry lifecycle, IMG residency, native mirrors, and dense-entity profiling |

These are capacity increases, not forced visual defaults. Distant lights are disabled by default, ordinary draw distances remain unchanged, and servers or client resources decide when to use the extended features. Legacy network connections retain MTA:SA's original position formats. The CULL relocation and Lua lifecycle have been exercised in game; dedicated tunnel and mirror capacity-boundary tests remain follow-up validation.

Project2DFX support currently covers distant static coronas and timed traffic lights using `SALodLights.dat`. Searchlight cones are recorded for future work; distant cars, static shadows, and the other Project2DFX modules are not included. The drag-and-drop skin and animation previews are intentionally insecure local development prototypes, not production or competitive-client features. Drop one IFP onto the game window to load its animation list; a one-animation file starts immediately, while multi-animation files can be searched and played from the in-game preview window with loop, freeze-last-frame, root-motion, speed, and blend controls. Technical design, executable address inventories, validation results, and reproducible limit-test resources are documented in [LIMIT_PATCHING.md](./LIMIT_PATCHING.md). Dense-entity profiling methodology and results are documented separately in [ENTITY_PERFORMANCE.md](./ENTITY_PERFORMANCE.md). The extended native minimap design and Lua API are documented in [EXTENDED_RADAR.md](./EXTENDED_RADAR.md). The proposed server-authoritative story runtime, reusable native task API, SCM compatibility layer, and co-op roadmap are documented in [STORY_RUNTIME.md](./STORY_RUNTIME.md).

### Extended-world validation examples

The repository includes reproducible resource pipelines that demonstrate the generic extended-world systems with concrete maps. A Perry Island slice validates terrain around X=9,000, while imported Liberty City, Vice City, Carcer City, and Bullworth resources exercise large IMG-backed map residency, per-client slot reuse, extended radar catalogs, and dynamic F11 composition.

These maps are test cases, not built-in Neon worlds or engine dependencies. Their generated game assets are intentionally excluded from Git and must be produced locally from legitimately obtained source material.

## Neon Lua API additions

Neon has added 25 unique Lua function names since its fork point at `ab2313ddc3fef299e34217465f8a2f3ef1806c6a`, and now also exposes server-side variants of the existing client functions `engineRequestModel` and `engineFreeModel`. Client functions run in downloaded client resources, server functions run in server resources, and client/server functions are available on both sides. Limit increases that do not introduce a callable Lua function remain documented in the comparison table above.

### Extended native radar

| Function | Side | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `engineSetRadarMapTile(column, row, txd)` | Client | Registers or replaces a resource-owned TXD in one extended 40 x 40 radar cell. Stock San Andreas cells are protected. |
| `engineResetRadarMapTile(column, row)` | Client | Removes a radar tile owned by the calling resource and restores the native ocean fallback for that cell. |
| `engineGetRadarMapStats()` | Client | Returns hook status and registered, loaded, failed, and compressed-source tile statistics. |

Radar tile registrations are resource-scoped: destroying their TXD or stopping the owning resource removes them automatically. See [EXTENDED_RADAR.md](./EXTENDED_RADAR.md) for coordinates, streaming behavior, and current constraints.

### Server-authoritative custom models

| Function | Side | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `engineRequestModel(type, parent [, name])` | Server | Allocates a stable, resource-owned logical model ID for an `object` or `vehicle` using a native GTA parent model. |
| `engineFreeModel(model)` | Server | Releases a logical model owned by the calling resource and remaps surviving elements to their native parent before clients free their runtime slots. |
| `engineGetModelParent(model)` | Server | Returns the native GTA parent of an active logical model, or `false` when the model is not registered. |
| `engineGetModelName(model)` | Server | Returns the active model's resource-qualified registry name, or `false` when the model is not registered. |
| `engineGetModelRuntimeID(serverModel)` | Client | Resolves a stable server model ID to the GTA runtime slot allocated on this client, or `false` when no slot is active. |
| `engineGetModelServerID(runtimeModel)` | Client | Reverse-resolves a client runtime slot to its stable server model ID, or `false` when it is not a server model. |

Logical IDs start at 30,000, are never reused during the server process, and remain independent from the runtime slot selected by each client. Clients without an active slot, including legacy clients, fall back to the model's native parent. Resource shutdown frees owned registrations automatically.

### Renderer and distant lights

| Function | Side | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `engineGetRendererStats()` | Client | Returns current usage, session high-water values, and capacities for visible entities, visible LODs, and streaming RenderWare objects. |
| `engineResetRendererStats()` | Client | Resets the renderer high-water measurement window without changing renderer capacities. |
| `engineSetDistantLightsEnabled(enabled)` | Client | Enables or disables Neon's native Project2DFX distant static lights. The feature is disabled by default. |
| `engineSetDistantLightsDrawDistance(distance)` | Client | Sets the distant-light draw distance from 300 to 5,000 world units. |
| `engineRebuildDistantLights()` | Client | Rebuilds the distant-light cache from the currently streamed world. |
| `engineGetDistantLightStats()` | Client | Returns enabled state, definition count, active corona count, corona capacity, and draw distance. |

### Native CULL zones

| Function | Side | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `engineGetCullZones([type])` | Client | Lists adopted native and custom CULL zones, optionally filtered by `attribute`, `tunnel`, or `mirror`. |
| `engineCreateCullZone(type, x, y, z, width, depth, height, flags, ...)` | Client | Creates a resource-owned CULL zone and returns its stable ID; optional arguments cover rotation and mirror-plane data. |
| `engineSetCullZone(id, type, x, y, z, width, depth, height, flags, ...)` | Client | Replaces an owned or claimed zone definition while retaining its stable ID. |
| `engineSetCullZoneEnabled(id, enabled)` | Client | Enables or disables a custom zone or a vanilla zone claimed by the calling resource. |
| `engineRemoveCullZone(id)` | Client | Removes a custom zone or temporarily removes a claimed vanilla zone. |
| `engineRestoreCullZone(id)` | Client | Restores a claimed vanilla zone to its original definition and releases the resource's edit state. |

Custom zones are deleted and edited vanilla zones are restored when their owning resource stops. Coordinates use GTA's signed 16-bit whole-unit representation, so fractional inputs are truncated.

### Marker diagnostics

| Function | Side | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `getMarkerLimitStats()` | Client | Returns streamed-marker usage and limits plus allocated 3D-marker, checkpoint, and direction-arrow capacities. |

### Procedural seabed

| Function | Side | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `setWorldSeaBedOuterBoundary(boundary)` | Server | Sets and synchronizes the square procedural-seabed boundary from 3,000 to 10,000 units; values are rounded up to GTA's 500-unit blocks. |
| `resetWorldSeaBedOuterBoundary()` | Server | Restores GTA's unlimited procedural seabed and synchronizes the reset to clients. |
| `getWorldSeaBedOuterBoundary()` | Server | Returns the applied boundary, or `false` while the seabed is unlimited. |

These functions affect only the rendered procedural seabed. They do not remove the infinite ocean or change water physics.

### Model-native ped walking styles

| Function | Side | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `setPedUseNativeWalkingStyle(ped, enabled)` | Client/server | Makes a ped use the current skin model's native motion group, or disables native selection and restores the default walking style. |
| `isPedUsingNativeWalkingStyle(ped)` | Client/server | Reports whether model-native walking-style selection is enabled for the ped. |

The mode follows skin changes, entity recreation, joins, and streaming. The OOP equivalents are `ped:setUseNativeWalkingStyle(enabled)`, `ped:isUsingNativeWalkingStyle()`, and the `ped.usingNativeWalkingStyle` property.

### Existing API extensions

Neon adds `fastweaponstrafe` as a server-synchronized, disabled-by-default option accepted by the existing `setGlitchEnabled` and `isGlitchEnabled` server functions:

```lua
setGlitchEnabled("fastweaponstrafe", true)
local enabled = isGlitchEnabled("fastweaponstrafe")
```

## Upstream relationship

Neon is built on [Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas](https://github.com/multitheftauto/mtasa-blue) and preserves its complete history and GPLv3 licensing. Neon-specific experiments and builds are maintained independently; use the upstream project for official MTA:SA downloads, documentation, and support.

## Build instructions

### Windows

Prerequisites
- [Visual Studio 2026](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with:
  - Desktop development with C++
  - Optional component *C++ MFC for latest v145 build tools (x86 & x64)* or if that's missing *C++ MFC for x64/x86 (Latest MSVC)*
- [Microsoft DirectX SDK](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Compiling_MTASA#Microsoft_DirectX_SDK)
- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (Optional)

1. Execute `win-create-projects.bat`
2. Open `MTASA.sln` in the `Build` directory
3. Compile
4. Execute: `win-install-data.bat`

Visit the wiki article ["Compiling MTASA"](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Compiling_MTASA) for additional information and error troubleshooting.

### GNU/Linux

The MTA:SA server can be built on GNU/Linux for x86, x86_64, armhf, and arm64. ARM configurations are experimental; x86_64 is the primary build environment and can be used to cross-compile the other architectures.

**Build dependencies**

*Please always read the utils/docker/Dockerfile for up-to-date build dependencies.*

- make
- GNU GCC compiler (version 10 or newer)
- libncurses-dev
- libmysqlclient-dev

**Build instructions: Script**

**Note:** This script always deletes `Build/` and `Bin/` directories and does a clean build.

```sh
$ ./linux-build.sh [--arch=x86|x64|arm|arm64] [--config=debug|release] [--cores=<n>]
$ ./linux-install-data.sh  # optional step
```

If build architecture `--arch` is not provided, then it's taken from the environment variable `BUILD_ARCHITECTURE` (defaults to: x64).

If build configuration `--config` is not provided, then it's taken from the environment variable `BUILD_CONFIG` (defaults to: release).

If the number of jobs `--cores` is not provided, then the build will default to the amount of CPU cores.

If you are trying to **cross-compile** to another architecture, then set `AR`, `CC`, `CXX`, `GCC_PREFIX` environment variables accordingly (see `utils/docker/Dockerfile` for an example).

**Build instructions: Manual**

```sh
$ ./utils/premake5 gmake
$ make -C Build/ config=release_x64 all
$ ./linux-install-data.sh  # optional step
```

If you don't want to build the release configuration for the x86_64 architecture, you can instead pick another build configuration from: `{debug|release}_{x86|x64|arm|arm64}`.

#### GNU/Linux: Docker Build Environment

If you have problems resolving the required dependencies or want maximum compatibility, you can use the upstream MTA:SA Docker image, which contains the required build dependencies.

**Pulling the Docker image**

```sh
$ docker pull ghcr.io/multitheftauto/mtasa-blue-build:latest
```

**Building with Docker**

These examples assume that your current directory is the Neon checkout. The image expects the source tree at `/build` inside the container. After compiling, you will find the resulting binaries in `./Bin`. To build the unoptimised debug build, add `--config=debug` to the Docker arguments.

```sh
# x86_64
docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/build ghcr.io/multitheftauto/mtasa-blue-build:latest --arch=x64

# x86
docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/build ghcr.io/multitheftauto/mtasa-blue-build:latest --arch=x86

# arm
docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/build ghcr.io/multitheftauto/mtasa-blue-build:latest --arch=arm

# arm64
docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/build ghcr.io/multitheftauto/mtasa-blue-build:latest --arch=arm64
```
