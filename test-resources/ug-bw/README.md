# GTA Underground Bullworth IMG streaming prototype

This resource imports the contiguous area-0 Bullworth exterior from GTA
Underground. The area-5 dorm interior is deliberately excluded. Two isolated
ladder placements with coordinates thousands of units outside the rest of the
town are also excluded explicitly by the generator.

Bullworth is translated by `-16500` on X and `-6500` on Y, placing it at
approximately X `-9040..-7463`, Y `7044..8409`. This north-west location does
not overlap San Andreas, Liberty City, Vice City, or Carcer City. The 500-unit
aligned translation lets the original UG radar tiles be copied without
resampling.

The 952 DFFs and 166 TXDs are packed in standard IMG VER2 archives. As with
the other resident-city resources, Bullworth remains active server-side while
each client assigns its finite dynamic model/TXD slots only to the city that
client is visiting.

## Commands

- `/bullytest` prepares the academy and teleports to Bullworth. (`/bwtest` is
  already reserved by the extended-world boundary test.)
- `/bwback` or `/bullyback` returns to San Andreas.
- `/bwstreamstats` reports IMG/model/TXD/placement state.
- `/bwradarstats` reports the extended radar state.
- `/bwinspect [radius]` and `/bwinspectaim` identify imported placements.

remain local for reproducibility but are intentionally not sent to clients as
individual resource files.
