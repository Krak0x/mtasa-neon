# Tagging Up Turf co-op prototype

This resource is the first vertical slice for Neon's planned story runtime. It recreates the gameplay route of GTA: San Andreas' `SWEET1` mission as an authoritative MTA Lua prototype. Its positions and stage order follow the decompiled `main.scm` mission, while its current actor, camera, and tag behaviors are deliberately replaceable experiments.

The target architecture is documented in [`STORY_RUNTIME.md`](../../STORY_RUNTIME.md). The long-term implementation will keep mission/SCM orchestration server-authoritative while moving reusable GTA tasks, tags, camera behavior, and other engine semantics into generic Neon C++ APIs.

## Play

1. Start the resource: `start tagging-up-turf`.
2. Connect one to three players.
3. Run `/tagup`. The player who starts the mission is the driver/leader.
4. Follow the objective banner and map markers. Hold fire with the spray can while aiming at each marked tag.

Development commands:

- `/tagupskip` advances the current stage (leader only).
- `/tagupabort` aborts and restores every participant's previous state.
- `/taguptrace [on|off]` or `F7` controls the local instruction-trace overlay.
- `/taguptracepreview` loads a presentation-only sample sequence for visual QA.

## Instruction trace component

`instruction_feed.lua` provides a generic client-side `TAGUP_TRACE` namespace. It is loaded before `client.lua` and receives presentation-only updates from the mission: toggling it cannot affect stage progression. The overlay is invisible by default, keeps completed instructions dimmed, highlights the current instruction and interpolated progress, and shows future instructions as queued.

The live sequence labels each entry honestly as a verified native opcode/task, SCM flow or condition, co-op adaptation, or temporary Lua substitute. Fast synchronous instructions can move directly into the dimmed history without being held on screen; the trace never delays gameplay just to animate the UI. `/taguptracepreview` remains a purely local visual sample.

The panel reuses the running `chatbox` resource's `fonts/Arial.ttf` through MTA's cross-resource path support. It creates larger dedicated header, instruction, detail, status, and footer fonts and falls back to built-in fonts if `chatbox` is unavailable. Its black, warm-orange, and ivory treatment intentionally follows San Andreas' original mission UI rather than Neon's modern green diagnostic styling.

```lua
TAGUP_TRACE.setSequence(steps, {title = "TAGGING UP TURF", subtitle = "CO-OP TRACE"})
TAGUP_TRACE.setCurrent(stepId [, detail])
TAGUP_TRACE.skipTo(stepId [, detail])
TAGUP_TRACE.setStatus(stepId, "queued" | "active" | "done" | "failed" | "skipped" [, detail])
TAGUP_TRACE.fail(stepId [, detail])
TAGUP_TRACE.setProgress(stepId, progress [, detail]) -- progress accepts 0..1 or 0..100
TAGUP_TRACE.reset()
TAGUP_TRACE.toggle([visible])
```

Sequence entries may be strings or tables containing `id`, `title`, `detail`, `status`, and `progress`. The component only draws local DX primitives and owns no timers, elements, mission tokens, or server events. The detailed native-task feed is intentionally available on the mission leader/syncer, which is the client that actually executes and observes Sweet's GTA tasks; other party members do not fabricate those observations locally.

## Current scope

The prototype includes an intro camera, shared co-op objectives, Sweet and his Greenwood, five sprayable tags, a Sweet demonstration, synchronized Ballas combat, mission failure, the return drive, rewards, and restoration of each player's pre-mission state. It uses dimension 4101 so it can run beside other test resources.

Tag hits and mission progress remain server-authoritative Lua because MTA disables GTA:SA's single-player `CTagManager`. The visual state now keeps each site's original tag model and drives its native Grove material through `setObjectGangTagAlpha`; it no longer crossfades two unrelated model IDs. The client reapplies this visual override whenever a tag streams in and clears it with `false` when the resource stops. A later synchronized native tag service can replace the Lua hit/progress rules without changing the material representation.

The SCM bytecode itself is not executed. Lua keeps the server-authoritative control flow, while verified native services now provide the reusable GTA camera, mission-audio, task, animation, and recorded-car behavior used by the implemented slices. This resource is a regression harness and architecture probe, not the intended mission-by-mission implementation strategy.

Sweet's first Idlewood demonstration now exercises Neon's native `setPedExitVehicle`, `setPedGoTo`, `setPedShootAt`, and `setPedEnterVehicle` paths using the `SWEET1` profiles. Arrival uses the SCM's grounded 4-by-4-by-4 locate box rather than the former 11 m sphere. Once it wins, every participant immediately acquires a control-inhibiting camera lease and preloads `SWE1_AR` plus `SWE1_CA`; the server does not start until all clients acknowledge both camera and audio. On the driver/syncer, that generic lease sets GTA's verified `bPlayerSafe` pad bit, making the Greenwood receive zero throttle, full brake, handbrake, and the native `0.28` speed clamp instead of a mission-specific velocity reset or freeze. The scene reproduces the three fixed shots, black-screen actor staging, native fades, widescreen, control inhibition, and simultaneous 10-second position/target tracks from the SCM. Only the leader may request a skip, but the server applies it to the whole party and restores gameplay under the black fade before every client fades back in.

The vehicle exit is no longer a server-side removal: the leader/syncer requests MTA's authoritative exit lifecycle, observes `TASK_COMPLEX_LEAVE_CAR`, and the server independently confirms `onVehicleExit` before it advances. Sweet then walks to `2100.48, -1649.14, 12.47`, applies shooting rate `100` and accuracy `90`, and starts the verified native shoot task. Reaching 100% interrupts that task and waits the SCM's following 1000 ms. The server then plays the existing synchronized `GRAFFITI_CHKOUT` animation with parameters equivalent to blend delta `4.0`, non-looped, interruptible, no root motion, no frozen final frame, and waits for the syncer to observe its natural end. Sweet walks back, every client plays `SWE1_CA` to natural completion, and all camera/audio releases are acknowledged before control returns. Sweet enters MTA passenger seat `1` (SCM passenger index `0`) concurrently with the two playable Idlewood tags. Facial lip-sync remains pending because Neon does not yet expose `CTaskComplexFacial::SetRequest`; the dialogue audio and timing no longer use substitute timers.

At the Ballas destination, the old `removePedFromVehicle` plus Sweet position teleport has also been removed. The trigger now uses the SCM's 4-by-4-by-4 locate box and a client-side grounded-vehicle gate instead of the former 13 m sphere; MTA's public grounded predicate is still weaker than the SCM's exact all-wheels condition. Every participant then acquires an independent resource-owned native camera lease. The server waits for all clients before starting the synchronized native leave-car lifecycle, reproducing the SCM fixed position, point-at target, widescreen state, control inhibition, and minimum 100 ms lead-in without racing another resource's camera or controls. Sweet carries a synchronized mission-actor policy which every client applies through `setPedMissionActor`; this reproduces SCM `CREATE_CHAR` and prevents GTA's four-second ambient passenger-abandonment sequence. Only after the server confirms that all players are outside does it persistently assign the leader as syncer for both Sweet and the Greenwood. The leader then calls `setPedDriveWander(sweet, greenwood, 20.0, "avoid_cars")`, observes `TASK_COMPLEX_CAR_DRIVE_WANDER`, and completes the SCM's following 1000 ms window before every client releases its camera lease and the Ballas tag stage begins. The verified installed `main.scm` contains no active seat-shuffle opcode here: Sweet intentionally remains passenger while GTA's autopilot drives the empty-driver vehicle. The original `SWE1_AV` voice line still controls part of this shot's duration in single-player and remains pending, so this slice validates the exact framing and lifecycle rather than claiming audio-perfect timing.

The two-Flats encounter now follows the separate one-shot gates in `SWEET1`: the server creates models 102 and 103 at their exact SCM positions when the leader enters the outer 50-by-50 box, then starts the shot only inside the 20-by-17 box while both actors are alive. All participants acquire the native camera lease before the server begins the exact fixed shot at `2400.3840, -1472.2081, 23.9349`, followed by the non-skippable 500 ms lead-in and the 6500 ms skip window. Only the leader may request a skip, but the server applies that decision to the whole party. Natural completion and skip share two barriers: every client first proves its lease is still valid, then releases it and acknowledges the actual restoration before the temporary Ballas AI can become hostile. The actors remain passive during setup and the shot, latched fire controls are cleared by their syncer, and damage from either actor is rejected locally until restoration completes. Their original chat, follow-offset, dialogue, and delayed attack tasks remain later fidelity work; the current combat after the shot is still the synchronized Lua substitute.

During the rooftop stage the leader preloads Rockstar recording `207`. Once the last tag is complete, the client cancels and verifies the end of Wander, the server moves Sweet from passenger to driver without moving the Greenwood, and only the vehicle's current syncer calls `startVehiclePlayback`. The first native frame performs the repositioning, so the former server-side position, rotation, and velocity writes are gone. GTA plays the 35-frame route for roughly eight seconds while ordinary unoccupied-vehicle sync replicates its transform. The client observes the native active state through natural completion, the server validates the recorded endpoint, and Sweet is restored to passenger seat 1 before the return drive. The original camera, dialogue, and audio around this sequence remain pending and are not presented as implemented.

The complete mission path has been validated in game: recording `207` ended naturally after `8040 ms`, the server measured `0.00 m` endpoint error, Sweet returned to passenger seat 1, and the subsequent Grove Street drive reached the mission-passed state.

The server validates every task token, ped and vehicle identity, mission stage, reporting client, sync ownership, server-side occupant transition, weapon, distance, and progress tick. Streaming loss, ownership loss, refusal, destruction, premature task termination, and guard timeout terminate the mission with explicit diagnostics instead of leaving the demo stuck. Progress drives the existing tag's synchronized Grove-material alpha up to `255`; this remains a temporary server-owned substitute and does not claim that MTA's disabled `CTagManager` accumulated native gameplay progress.
